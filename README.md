# Text Sentiment Analysis Using CNN

Text Sentiment Analysis Using CNN is a project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze and classify the sentiment of textual data. The goal of this project is to automatically determine whether a given text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Project Overview

This project report provides an overview of the steps involved in building the text sentiment analysis system using CNN. It covers data preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and usage of the trained model for sentiment classification.

### Data Preprocessing

The first step in the project is to preprocess the textual data. This typically involves steps such as removing punctuation, tokenization, lowercasing, and removing stop words. Additionally, techniques like stemming or lemmatization may be applied to normalize the text further.

### Model Architecture

For sentiment classification, a CNN model is used. The model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to extract relevant features from the text. These features are then fed into fully connected layers with dropout regularization to classify the sentiment. The architecture may include techniques like embedding layers to capture semantic meaning in the text.

### Training

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of text samples with sentiment labels. The dataset is split into training and validation sets. During training, the model learns to optimize its parameters by minimizing a loss function using techniques like gradient descent or Adam optimization. The training process involves iterating over the dataset for multiple epochs to improve the model's performance.

### Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated using a separate test dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness in sentiment classification. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation or k-fold validation may be used for more robust evaluation.

### Usage

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used for sentiment classification on new, unseen text data. The text is preprocessed following the same steps as during training, and then fed into the trained model for prediction. The model outputs a sentiment label, indicating whether the text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Conclusion

Text Sentiment Analysis Using CNN is a project that demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks for sentiment classification. By preprocessing the textual data, building an appropriate model architecture, and training the model on labeled data, accurate sentiment classification can be achieved. This project provides a valuable tool for analyzing sentiment in text and can be applied to various applications such as social media sentiment analysis, customer reviews, and more.
